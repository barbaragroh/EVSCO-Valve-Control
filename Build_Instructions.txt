Project: EVCSO Valve Control

Description: Open and Close an EVSCO valve based on geographical position in relation to ports within a database.
		The valve should open in open ocean, and close when it gets within range of a port in the database.
		The valve can be controlled remotely over the network using a web server.

Hardware: The project requires an EVSCO S2-PP-RE13 valve, a Raspberry Pi, a PiFace Digital add-on, an 8 GB SD Card, and an ethernet cable
	The valve is necessary because it is going to be controlled to keep instruments from getting contaminated by polluted port water.
	The Raspberry pi will be running the programs that control the valve as well as hosting the apache web server.
	The 8GB SD Card serves as the Raspberry pi's hard drive and will hold all of the programs.
	The PiFace Digital is an addition to the pi that allows it to recieve/send information from/to the outside world, i.e. sensors, lights, buttons, motors.
	The Ethernet cable will connect the Pi to the network to make the web server accessible remotely so that the valve can be controlled by any computer on the network.
Software:
	Raspbian: An operating system for the user to interact with the hardware
	Editors:
		nano (very basic editor)
		leafpad (optional)
		gedit (optional)
		IDLE: Python Editor (recommended)
	Python: The language that controls the valve. This downloads the necessary libraries for the Pi to understand and execute the code.
	PHP 5: This is the language that runs the web server.
	SQLite: This comes with PHP 5, but it is important to be sure to have
	SQLite GUI: This allows one to visually edit the database.
	Apache2:This is the web server that is going to operate the site
	Git: this will allow you to pull the necessary files from their remote location on the GitHub repository.
Files:
	index.php: This is the homepage for the web server. It has options to open/close the valve as well as view/edit the database of ports.
	database.php: This is the webpage that allows one to view the database of ports remotely.
	edit_database.php: This is the webpage that allows one to edit the database of ports remotely. Ports can be added, changed, or deleted.
	raspiValveControl.py: This is the python file that runs the gps coordinates and compares them to port locations to open and close the valve according to position.
	newRaspiValveControl.py: a documented version of raspiValveControl.py that may or may not work
	open.py: This file simply opens the valve. It is called in index.php.
	Close.py: This file simplu closes the valve. It is called in index.php.
	portLocations.db: This is the SQLite database that contains the ports, their latitudes, longitudes and the radii in which the valve should be closed. 
	haversine.py:A file that the other python programs use to operate.
	openSocketTest.py, EvscoValveControl.py.bak, EvscoValveControl.py, test.py, raspiValveControl.py.bak, true.py, EvscoValveControl.pyc, false.py, raspiValveControl.pyy, sqliteTest.py, close1, haversine.pyc: possibly important files

Possible Necessary Changes to files:
	The files interact with each other based on file name as well as their individual and unique file paths.
	It may be necessary to alter the file paths used in the code based on where the called files are stored in the new version of the project that one makes.
	The files that may need altering are:
		index.php
		database.php
		edit_database.php
		raspiValveControl.py
		newRaspiValveControl.py
	The files have certain  lines that contain a file path (ex: /var/www/portLocations.db) that may need adjustment. Simply change the path. This can be found in the file's properties.

Step 1: Prepare the SD Card
	Preparing the SD card sets up the operating system for the Pi. This step requires a functional computer with an SD card slot and internet access.
	-- Plug the SD card into the computer's SD card slot
	-- Find the location of the SD Card by typing these commands into the terminal:
		ls /mnt (will give you a list of the directories in the /mnt directory
		cd /mnt/sdc1 (a command that allows you to work within the /mnt/sdc1 folder so that changes only affect that folder)
		ls /dev/sd (will give you a list of directories or files within the dev folder that begin with sd)
			the output of the previous command will give a list similar to: sda  sda1 sda2 sdb sdb1 sdb2
			This output refers to the different drives mounted to the computer. sda is always the computer's hard drive NEVER write to sda
			The SD card we are working with is most likely sdb. sdb1 and sdb2 are divisions within sdb. We need to work with the whole thing, so use sdb.
		Now we know that the card's file is sdb.
	-- Navigate on your browser to http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads and download the raspbian torrent. Downloading the file may take a while, so be patient.
	-- Once you open the installer that was just downloaded, allow it to torrent the raspbian file. This may take a while, depending on the speed of internet and the accessibility of peers to torrent from.
	-- Once the raspbian image is downloaded, make note of the image's location. 
	-- Enter these commands into the terminal of your computer:
		cd~ (This takes you to the home directory)
		pwd (to check that you are in the home directory)
		ls (to give a list of files and directories in the home directory so that you know that the image is in the home directory. The file should look like: "2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img" or some variation, depending on the version)
		sudo dd if=./2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img (or some variation) of=/dev/sdb (this actually moves the image into the sd card. you may be asked to enter your computer's password)
	-- Transferring the image may take a while, so be patient
	-- Unmount the SD card (just pull it out) and plug it into the SD card slot 

Step 2: Prepare the Raspbery Pi
	-- Make sure that the raspberry pi has all the hardware it needs to boot up:
		monitor (via HDMI port)
		mouse (via usb port)
		keyboard (via usb port)
		SD card (via sd card slot)
		micro usb power source (via micro usb port)
		ethernet cable (via ethernet cable port)
	-- Since it is the first boot, you will arrive at a blue screen with options. It is possible to change the login information, language, etc. Use the keyboard to select the language options
		-- The default language is UK English, but it is important to switch to US english. There will be a white box, and scroll until you reach an option similar to en-US-UTF-8. Press the spacebar to select this language. Go up to en-UK-XXXX where you will see a star within brackets, and press the space bar. This de-selects UK english.
	-- Tab down to <OK> and the pi should boot. Eventrually it will ask for a login. The default is pi. Press enter and you will be prompted for a password, which should be raspberry.
	-- Update and upgrade the pi so that the desktop is functional by entering these commands into the terminal:
		sudo apt-get update (this updates the computer's list of applications)
		sudo apt-get upgrade (this upgrades the computer's desktop based on the applications)
	-- You are still within the terminal. To get to the desktop, enter the command "startx"
		If the User Interface seems to have no navigation bar, restart the pi.
		type these commands:
			sudo apt-get purge openbox
			sudo apt-get purge lxde
			sudo apt-get install lxde
			sudo apt-get install openbox
			sudo apt-get install xfce4
			sudo apt-get install xfce4-goodies
			startxfce4
		Now, the desktop should work
	--open the terminal and type these commands to get the necessary files
		sudo apt-get install git
		clone https://github.com/barbaragroh/EVSCO-Valve-Control
	--test the piFace by entering these commands
		sudo apt-get install python{,3}-pifacedigitalio
		sudo apt-get install python3-pifacedigital-emulator
		sudo raspi-config
		(navigate to advanced options, SPI and select yes and select always run SPI kernel)
		sudo reboot (will restart the pi)
		startxfce4
		(open the terminal again)
		python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-pifacedigitalio/examples/blink.py (this tests the piface)
		(if no errors pop up, enter Ctrl C to end the test)
	-- Open the piface emulator. In the terminal type:
		pifacedigital-emulator
		(enable output controls and play with the numbers to make sure the corresponding LEDs come on)
	-- Set up the web server. Apache 2 must be installed, along with the php plugin. Terminal Commands:
		sudo apt-get install apache2
		sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5
		/etc/init.d/apache2 restart (restarts apache)
Hardware: The project requires an EVSCO S2-PP-RE13 valve, a Raspberry Pi, a PiFace Digital add-on, an 8 GB SD Card, and an ethernet cable
        The valve is necessary because it is going to be controlled to keep instruments from getting contaminated by polluted port water.
        The Raspberry pi will be running the programs that control the valve as well as hosting the apache web server.
        The 8GB SD Card serves as the Raspberry pi's hard drive and will hold all of the programs.
        The PiFace Digital is an addition to the pi that allows it to recieve/send information from/to the outside world, i.e. sensors, lights, buttons, motors.
        The Ethernet cable will connect the Pi to the network to make the web server accessible remotely so that the valve can be controlled by any computer on the network.
Software:


Step 3: Set up Files
	--The files need to be moved to their proper places on the computer in order for the valve to function. These are the commands:
		sudo cp /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/index.php /var/www (moves index.php to apache2 server)
		sudo cp /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/database.php /var/www (moves database.php)
		sudo cp /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/edit_database.php /var/www (moves edit_database.php)
		sudo cp /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/portLocations.db /var/www (moves portLocations.db database)
		rm /var/www/index.html (removes default index file)
	-- Be sure that the file EVSCO-Valve-Control is in the /home/pi folder

Step 4: Opening the Web Server
	-- Find the IP Adress of the Pi. Terminal Command:
		ifconfig (the IP Address will look similar to "10.16.200.140")
	-- Open the browser of another computer on the same network as the pi and type the Pi's IP Address into the address bar. The opening page should appear.
	-- Try clicking the "view ports" or "edit ports" buttons. when the page appears, does it have the table of ports?
		If so, then continue to the next step
		If not, then follow these steps
			-- check the error log by entering this command into the Pi:
				tail /var/log/apache2/error.log
			-- the error should contain "PHP Fatal error: Class 'SQLite3' not found in"
			-- This means that SQLite is not installed. Enter the following commands into the terminal
				sudo apt-get install php5-cli php5-dev make
				sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev
				sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite
			-- now reload the browser on the computer. The tables should appear. If they do not, enter these commands:
				cd /var/www
				sudo chown www-data:www-data portLocations.db
	-- Try adding, editing and deleting indeces to the database. If the functions work, then move to the next step, if not, follow these steps:
		--The issue is most likely a permissions problem. Type these commands into the terminal:
			sudo chown root:www-data /var/www
			sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www
			sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/*
			sudo chmod 666 /var/www/*
		--Try adding, editing and deleting again. The functions should now function.
	-- Now go to the home page and try opening/closing the valve. The valve is not connected yet, but the Pi should still make a clicking sound
		If the pi makes a sound, the valve will work, and move on to the next step
		If the pi is silent, follow these steps
			-- The problem may be one of two. Enter this command into the terminal:
				tail /var/log/apache2/error.log
					If the last error contains "Have you enabled the SPI module?" the problem is with permissions (becuase we have already enabled SPI)
			-- Also try entering this command:
				python /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/close.py
					If there is an error that contains "No module named" followed by a name that contains "piface," the problem is a naming problem
			-- It is possible to have both problems, so try both commands.
			-- If the problem is with permissions:
				sudo chmod 666 /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/* (setting all files in the directory to readable and writable settings)
				sudo usermod -a -G spi www-data (adding spi to the www-data groups)
				sudo usermod -a -G gpio www-data (adding gpio to the www-data groups)
				sudo service apache restart (restarting apache)
			-- If the problem is with naming:
				-- PiFace may have changed the name of the module, so one of the python scripts needs to be updated. 
				   Previous names have been "piface.pfio" and "pifacedigitalio", so find the new name online or by opening one of the python scripts that came with the piface download
				-- Enter this command
					gedit /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/EvscoValveControl.py
						Now, this is a short python script that may have a problem. 
						It contains a line "import piface.pfio as pfio" or "import pifacedigitalio as pfio"
						Change the second word ("piface.pfio" or "pifacedigitalio") to the new module name
				-- Try entering this command again:
					python /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/close.py
						It should work.
			
	-- The web server is working! Now, it is time to set up the valve
	
Step 5: Setting up the Valve
	--It is time to connect the valve to the pi!
  	--This is a model of the pi with the PiFace
    	                                                                __

	--Wiring for the inside of the EVSCO Valve: 
		*It doesn't matter if the wire has writing or not, but the same wire that starts in the slot on the valve labeled for the wire with writing must end in the slot labeled for wire with writing on the Pi

	WARNING: If the wire with/without writing are wired wrong, the open and close functions for the valve will be backwards, and non of the code will work properly

	--Test the valve to make sure it works
Step 6: Connecting to AMVERSEAS
	--This is the program that will send the Pi GPS locations from a computer within the ship
	--Find the computer's IP address, and open raspiValveControl.py on the Pi
	--Change the given IP address to the IP address of the computer on the ship. Make sure that both the computer and Pi are connected to the same network
	--download AMVERSEAS if the computer does not already have it
	--on the SEAS control, open the SEAS Tranceiver Interface
	--go to the Transmitter tab and make sure that Socket-Server configuration is on
	--set the Socket-Server port numer to 4
		--if the port number must be set to any number other than 4, that must also be changed on the raspiValveControl.py program, next to where the computer's IP address is located
	--restart the Transceiver interface, and the valve should now be working

Step 7: Reconfigure Pi
	--The pi needs to be able to log in automatically and launch the tracking program as soon as it powers up
	--In the terminal, enter:
		sudo nano /etc/inittab
	--find this line: "1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1" and insert a "#" at the beginning
	--just below the line, add a new line that reads:
		1:2345:respawn:/bin/login/ -f pi tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
	--save and exit the editor
	--In the terminal, enter:
		sudo nano /etc/profile
	-- add the following line to the end of the file:
		. /home/pi/EVSCO-Valve-Control/raspiValveControl.py
	-- save and exit the editor
	-- if you turn the Pi off, then on again, it should start running the program automatically
